On a sunny day, the autonomous vehicle under test turned left through the intersection. A bicycle suddenly turns left from the right side of the intersection, forcing the autonomous vehicle under test to brake abruptly to avoid a collision. Concurrently, an oncoming vehicle attempts to pass through the intersection quickly and also brakes abruptly to prevent a collision.

On a rainy day, two vehicles on the opposite side of the road suddenly turn around and accelerate to make a right turn across the intersection. This maneuver results in a merging conflict with the autonomous vehicle under test, leading to a near collision.

# Heckstrasse_simulation_video_1.mp4:
At dawn, the autonomous vehicle under test encounters a lorry that suddenly appears in its blind spot, prompting an emergency brake. After passing through the intersection, another bicycle suddenly appears, blocking the autonomous vehicleâ€™s path and necessitating another emergency brake to avoid a collision.

# Heckstrasse_simulation_video_2.mp4:
On a foggy day, the autonomous vehicle under test encounters a pedestrian crossing the road, followed by a conflict with another vehicle turning left. The autonomous vehicle under test applies emergency brakes to avoid these collisions and subsequently conflicts with a bicycle while completing the turn.
