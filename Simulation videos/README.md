On a sunny day, the AV turned left through the intersection. A bicycle suddenly turns left from the right side of the intersection, forcing the AV to brake abruptly to avoid a collision. Concurrently, an oncoming vehicle attempts to pass through the intersection quickly and also brakes abruptly to prevent a collision.

On a rainy day, two vehicles on the opposite side of the road suddenly turn around and accelerate to make a right turn across the intersection. This maneuver results in a merging conflict with the tested AV, leading to a near collision.

# Heckstrasse_simulation_video_1.mp4:
At dawn, the AV encounters a lorry that suddenly appears in its blind spot, prompting an emergency brake. After passing through the intersection, another bicycle suddenly appears, blocking the AVâ€™s path and necessitating another emergency brake to avoid a collision.

On a foggy day, the AV encounters a pedestrian crossing the road, followed by a conflict with another vehicle turning left. The AV applies emergency brakes to avoid these collisions and subsequently conflicts with a bicycle while completing the turn.
